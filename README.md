# EvolGPT: Expert-Level Performance on Tasks with Environmental Feedback
The simplest state-of-the-art arbitrary task solution generator using gpt-4 API calls and evolutionary search.

# Introduction
There has recently been a slew of papers achieving expert-level performance on different tasks:
* AlphaGeometry by DeepMind
* Eureka: Human-Level Reward Design
* Phenomenal Yet Puzzling: Testing Inductive Reasoning
And many others. 

They all use the same idea: some variant of evolutionary search, and reward reflection.

**Evolutionary search:** sampling N independent sample solutions for the task from an LLM, evaluating them all in the "environment" for the task, picking the best one, and generating N variations of it, repeating that for T iterations.

**Reward Reflection:** giving the model some sort of feedback on why the current best solution failed to get zero loss on the task. For instance, if you wanted to generate a maximally efficient algorithm for a problem, the feedback could be the output of a profiler.

The repositories I saw so far have (in my opinion) all been engineered to solve a very specific task and are difficult to extend, or unnecessarily complex, so I've decided to create EvolGPT as a simple and generic version of this method. 

# Demo Task
The current demo task is taken from the Inductive Reasoning paper:


```
Find the rule mapping X to Y in the following examples and express it as a Python function:

[97, 97, 97, 97] -> [97, 97, 97]

[4, 4, 4] -> [4, 4]

[33, 0, 4, 1, 2, 24, 66] -> []

[76, 42, 17, 76, 17] -> [76, 17]

...
```


I've verified it is consistently solved by EvolGPT with T=3 and N=5 (the hyperparameters used in the paper).
More difficult tasks should use higher T, N, for instance, Eureka used T=5 and N=16.

## Running the demo:

1. Git clone the repository

2. Install the requirements
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
The python version I tested it on is 3.10.

3. Export your API key as an environment variable
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY='yourkey'
```

4. Run the command (**Careful**! It'll run **exec()** on GPT-4 generated code, and cost about 10 cents)
```
python3 main.py
```

## Changing the task:
I believe the code is relatively well organized and commented. To change the task you need to modify evaluate.py and system_prompt.txt. To change the hyperparameters look inside config.yaml.
