# EvolGPT: Expert-Level Performance on Tasks with Fast Feedback

There has recently been a slew of papers achieving expert level performance on different tasks using an LLM:
* AlphaGeometry by DeepMind
* Eureka: Human-Level Reward Design
* Phenomenal Yet Puzzling: Testing Inductive Reasoning
And many others. 

In my opinion, it should be emphasized that they all use the same core idea: evolutionary search, and reward reflection.

**Evol**utionary search: sampling N indepdent sample solutions for the task from an LLM, evaluating them all in the "environment" for the task, picking the best one, and generating N variations of it, repeating that for some amount T iterations.

Reward Reflection: giving the model some sort of feedback on why the current best solution failed to get zero loss on the task. For instance, if you wanted to generate a maximally efficient algorithm for a problem, the feedback could be the output of a profiler. The loss could be the runtime, or failed test cases if there are any.

The repositories I saw so far have (in my opinion) all been engineered to solve a very specific task and difficult to extend, or unnecessarily complex, so I've decided to create EvolGPT as a simple and generic version of this method. The current demo task is taken from the Inductive Reasoning paper:

> Find the rule mapping X -> Y in the following examples and express it as a Python function:
[97, 97, 97, 97] -> [97, 97, 97]
[4, 4, 4] -> [4, 4]
[33, 0, 4, 1, 2, 24, 66] -> []
[76, 42, 17, 76, 17] -> [76, 17]

And I've verified it can indeed be solved consistantly with T=3 and N=5 (the hyperparameters used in the paper).
More difficult tasks should use higher T,N, for instance Eureka used T=5 and N=16.

## Usage:

1. Git clone the repository

2. Install the requirements:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
The python version I tested it on is 3.10.

3. Export your API key as an enviroment variable:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY='yourkey'
```

5. Run the command (**Careful**! It'll run exec() on GPT-4 generated code, and cost about 10 cents):
```
python3 main.py
```
